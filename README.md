# Fractals Rage

In our view, Information is somehow like the [Fractals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCpLWbHVNhk (it's MATH :wink:)

1. How to construct a "Linear paths" inside our "Nonlinear World" using TW5 as a Bridge/Interface
2. How to Manage the "Nonlinear" building Blocks with thier Relations (as [Entity Relationship Modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/relationship-modeling) ) using TW5 , where:
    * Each Tiddler is an "Entity" or "Fractal Point Set" (it may be expanded to a whole world later, so it's "Point" NOW and maybe "Set" in the future )
    * Tags are the "adjective" of that "Point Set"
    * Fields are the "Attributes" ("Internal Attributes" and "Relationships Attributes")
